## Review

### Intro

When Baldur's Gate 3 first came out, I didn't even know what that game was. It was just another turn-based asymmetric game that I didn't care about. However, the success of the game, and the impact it had on the gaming industry could not be ignored. Some developers were openly angry about the game's success because they felt like nothing they make comes close to the quality and polish that Baldur's Gate 3 has, and that commands respect for BG3 developers.

So, the game has managed to pique my interest. Because 2023 was a chaotic time in my life, I decided to put the game on my backlog to wait for a slower time in my life. Almost 2 years later, in early 2025, I finally bought the game and have started my journey completely blind, expecting a completely amazing experience.

### Act 1

I was met with an amazing character creation screen, and it took me 2 hours to create a character. The class I chose was a warrior, with an idea to two-hand a big sword (Very original I know...), then I proceeded to create another character, which I put a lot of effort into, thinking it would be important, and just like that I was in! Playing one of the most decorated games in recent years.

The beginning of Act 1 was rough, I was dying constantly and I dreaded combat, but I had the will to learn and study the combat system. I reached the Chapel and, naively, entered the hole just to get ambushed by another adventuring party.

To be honest, they kicked my ass. I must've spent 2 hours trying to kill them, and eventually, I succeeded. My party was barely alive but that fight was truly a baptism of fire for me. After that, I learned the basics of combat and continued on my journey much more comfortably.

Shortly after, I reached the Emerald Grove and by that point, I was completely hooked. The sheer number of different quests, shops, and interactable NPCs was mind-blowing to me. By this point, I had accumulated about 10 hours in the game and felt pretty confident in my ability to play the game.

I managed to do almost everything there is to do in Act 1, every adventure felt unique. My first tough boss was Auntie Ethel and killing her felt satisfying. Eventually, I arrived at the famous Goblin Camp, which was used many times by reviewers as an example of Baldur's Gate 3's greatness when it comes to solving a problem in a variety of different ways.

I managed to enter the camp peacefully and eventually, I got into a fight with goblins which I had no problem killing since I had cleared all of Act 1 previously. I entered the side room and had a fight with Minthara, who I also killed, not knowing she could be a party member.

I proceeded to rescue Halsin and return to the Grove, where I saved the Tieflings and moved on to the next part of the game, the Rosymorn Monastery. This is where Baldur's Gate 3 peaked for me, and it all went downhill from here.

The Lae'zel and the Githyanki storyline was very interesting to me, discovering all the secrets that the monastery has to offer was some of the best RPG experiences I've ever had in a game. The overall vibe of that part of the map and the Githyanki Creche I eventually entered were immaculate.

Lae'zel's storyline reached the boiling point, and since I didn't really like Giths and their Queen Vlaakith especially, I did not want to give them the mysterious object and a fight broke out, where I was forced to kill Lae'zel. I liked her more than some of the other companions so it was a bummer that I had to kill her, but overall, I was happy with my choice in the story. I proceeded to acquire the Orphic Hammer and learn the truth about Orpheus. Now I was completely ready to go into Act 2!

### Act 2

Before entering Act 2, I was immediately met with a choice: to go underground or through the Mountain Pass. I'm not a big fan of caves and underground levels in games, so I decided to go through the Mountain Pass, thinking that it would be an epic adventure, and a memorable chunk of the game on its own.

When I arrived in the Shadow-Cursed Lands, a creepy spider dude met me and offered to escort me through the pass. I thought that was the way to proceed so I accepted. Shortly after, we were ambushed by another party. Seeing as though I had no reason to betray the spider dude, and these guys had attacked us out of the blue, I decided to stick with the spider guy and we made quick work of the adventurers that attacked us.

I later found out that these adventurers were the 'good guys', but it was too late, and the game did not really communicate that well. Nevertheless, we arrived at the Moonrise Towers, somewhat disappointed that the infamous 'Mountain Pass' did not prove to be an adventure, but rather a short stroll with the spider guide.

The towers are amazingly crafted, and I spent a lot of time exploring, trading with merchants, and overall interacting with every NPC I could. I decided to play it cool and fake allegiance with the Cultists, even though I really disliked them.

When I decided to explore the Shadow-Cursed Lands, I was met with a surprise when my party kept entering turn-based mode, then I figured out that I had to use the lantern to not get affected by the curse. This mechanic was extremely annoying since you couldn't carry the sword and the lantern at the same time, so fighting enemies was pure pain.

I entered the Waning Moon tavern, and unknowingly walked into a tough fight with the boss Thisobald Thorm unprepared. This cost me a lot of time since I had to load a save from an hour ago, because I couldn't beat him without some prep. I must've spent maybe an hour in the Shadow-Cursed Lands before I entered the Gauntlet of Shar.

I met with Balthazar and his cronies and I still pretended to be on their side. The challenge puzzles were fun in concept but the execution was terrible, it's like the developers forgot how finicky the controls were. It took me around 3–4 hours to complete the whole Gauntlet, and although the whole level was a lot of fun, at the end I felt more exhausted than entertained.

The fight with Balthazar was somewhat long, since he ran away constantly, but overall it wasn't that hard. The previous boss fight, with Yurgir, was much harder. I convinced Shadowheart to abandon Shar and turn to a more positive light. We rescued Nightsong and overall I really liked this story moment, and this solidified Shadowheart as a character I really like.

After that I did most of the side stuff I was able to do around the Shadow-Cursed Lands, including finding the Last Light Inn, which I missed before, and going through the House of Healing which had a pretty fun boss fight and some cool loot. Unfortunately, not being able to find a way to lift the curse, I decided to face off against Ketheric Thorm. The fight until we reached the top of the Tower wasn't particularly hard, and it was entertaining, but not particularly memorable. That also goes for the first fight against Thorm at the top of the castle.

After descending to the Mind Flayer colony, I felt good that I was able to rescue my former allies and recruit them for the final fight of the game. The rematch with Thorm, now as an Apostle of the God of death Myrkul, was fun. It pushed me to the limits, but with Nightsong's help we managed to beat him. The fight was both visually and mechanically fun.

I was happy that I was able to save Gale, who became one of my personal favorite characters, both in story, but also to play as. By this point, I had clocked around 30 hours and decided to move on to Act 3. I've read that some people spent 50 hours just in Act 2, and I simply don't know how that is possible since I was pretty thorough, and I spent around 15.

### Act 3

Moving on to Act 3, I was happy that I was out of the cursed lands, and I was pretty excited for Act 3 since I thought that this is where the game would peak. I was, unfortunately, very wrong. Very excited to arrive in the big city, I went into full exploration mode immediately, and I didn't pay much attention to the main quest.

The main two villains were not that good. Gortash seemed like a boring tyrant, and Orin was, for my taste, too over-the-top edgy and annoying. She wasn't a villain I admired; I simply hated having to listen to her and look at her. She must've picked up on the fact that I didn't really like her, and she punished me by kidnapping Gale, one of the strongest and most fun party members.

This mechanic was beyond annoying, since I couldn't rescue Gale before I proved myself “worthy” to her by completing the murder tribunal and killing Gortash. This is exactly what I didn't want. I wanted to enjoy exploring the city with the party of my choice, but instead, the game forces you to progress the story way too early if you want to rescue your companion.

I did not want to do that, of course, and this is where the illusion of having the choice in the game started to break. I slowly started realizing that there isn't much choice when it comes to the main story. You have the obvious good outcome and obvious bad one, and all of the others always lead to one of those more or less.

And then, probably the most annoying and immersion-breaking moment of the game happened. Partly turning into a mind flayer. This is a good time to talk about the Emperor. Ever since he betrayed my trust, I despised him. He pretended to be someone else just to trick me into helping him. Seeing the secondary character I created be used cheaply like that annoyed me a little.

I did not want to help free Orpheus because I did not see any benefit in doing so. My whole idea of my role in this role-playing game was that I would stay human towards the end, and that I would fight the mind flayer inside my head with all my powers. You can imagine how annoyed I was when the Emperor turned me partly into a mind flayer, and I had zero choice! It was all left up to a stupid dice throw. A character-altering important decision was a DICE throw!

Until the end of the game, I looked very ugly and the game denied me the satisfaction of playing as a cool medieval knight because I had a red and purple face and eyes, completely breaking my original intention of remaining human.

Moving on to the city itself, there is a famous phrase “the gift that keeps on giving” — the city of Baldur's Gate was the disappointment that keeps disappointing. Every single meaningful quest and interaction was through the quest book. There was nothing interesting I discovered by simply exploring on my own, and believe me, I have scoured every cobblestone of the city multiple times.

The character stories were probably the best part, so let's view them in order.

### Character Stories

- **Wyll**: Unfulfilling. Imagine how excited I was to face the legendary dragon Ansur, just for it to turn out into absolutely nothing. No outcome came from it, just a dead end. After that, I tackled the steel foundry. That storyline was cool, with the trapped families of the workers. However, the fights were very boring because the enemies just kept coming, and the fight against the Steel Watcher Titan was particularly annoying since every attack of the enemy seemed to halve or even one-shot my health.
  Beating this boss led me to the Iron Throne which, in all fairness, was a fun level. Rescuing everyone kept me on edge and it was really narrow. I managed to rescue everybody except, of course, Wyll's father, which was yet another “middle finger” from the game, since this was another disappointing end to a storyline.
- **Astarion**: Astarion’s story had a cool idea, and it would be one of the best, if not for the Cazador fight. There isn't really much to say about this boss fight. You are time-limited to rescue Astarion or he will permanently die, and the mechanic of having to stand at certain areas to weaken Cazador was annoying since your characters were left there undefended to be punched. This was pure torture and to be honest, I couldn't even believe it when I managed to kill him.

I talked sense into Astarion and he remained as he was before, refusing the temptation of becoming the all-powerful vampire like Cazador. I really enjoyed his character conclusion, even though he was probably my least favorite companion.

- **Shadowheart**: Shadowheart’s story I was really excited to see through. Her finding out that she was tricked all along and that her parents were still alive was heartbreaking, especially because they sacrificed themselves in order to save her, but at least they died on their own terms. This little ending to the story would've been amazing, but again, like in Astarion's case, the boss fight against Shadowheart's former caretaker Mother Superior Viconia was torturous.

Her shape-shifting and darkness spells were annoying and I really struggled against her even though I had very good equipment and fighting strategy. This fight, along with the Cazador fight, is the second-worst fight in the game.

- **Karlach**: This is the first time I'm mentioning Karlach in this review, that's because she is a simple, likable character and there really isn't much I can talk about her. I'm satisfied with the ending I got for her story, which was to go on with Wyll and live in the hell world.
- **Gale**: Gale's story ended well too. He survived everything, despite the chances, and remained himself at the end. Shame the game pretty much forced me to play the whole Act 3 without him because he was kidnapped by Orin.

### Finishing Main Quests

Onto the main quests. Fighting Gortash was as fun as his personality was, that's to say it was really boring and bland. I killed him without any sweat and had moved on pretty quickly. Facing Orin proved to be more challenging and more fun, although invisible shadow enemies made me tear my hair out.

The whole Cult of Bhaal plot was fun, and the Undercity areas were designed very well. The final fight against Orin was surprisingly fun, but not too hard. It was properly balanced and fun to engage with. It's up there with Thorm's fight as one of the best boss fights in the game. If Orin as a character had more depth and was less annoying, her whole storyline would've been the highlight of the game in my eyes.

### End Game

Now we have finally reached the culmination, the face-off with the Netherbrain. Once the invasion starts, you face hundreds of filler enemies in your way to reach the Netherbrain. There is a really cool moment where you give a speech in front of all your allies before the final battle.

Eventually, you reach it — the final battle of Baldur's Gate 3, and I'll be blunt: it's the worst fight in the game. Not because it's the hardest (although it is really hard — so hard that I had to drop the game for a week and come back after some time had passed), but that's not the worst part.

What truly sucks about this fight is that you first have to face around 10 to 12 boss-level enemies that will kick your ass. It will take you around 10–15 minutes to finally unlock the portal to the Netherbrain, and then you manually have to walk with each character through the portal in order to fight the Netherbrain. So basically, your 4 characters are fighting on two separate fronts.

Unfortunately, the allies are useless — they are complete cannon fodder — and their only use is to tank one hit from the enemy. I somehow managed to get 3 of my characters, barely alive, through the portal, and struggled to hit him, but after another 10 minutes I managed to deplete his health bar. Then, I was met with a couple of options regarding the endings.

### Endings

Because of my resentment towards the Emperor and mind flayers, and my original role-playing style to preserve humanity, I denied the Emperor's ascend into godhood. I managed to free everyone from the mind flayer influence and I consider this a very satisfying ending. Probably the best ending for me.

When it comes to other endings, the evil endings didn't interest me at all, and since I didn't interact with Orpheus at all, he wasn't involved in my ending.

### Some Details

Now I want to comment on some details that aren't story-related. I want to compliment the composers, because the music in this game is a masterpiece, truly sets the bar with so many unique scores. Visuals and gameplay are done very well, the overall art design is very pleasant to watch and to imagine yourself in the world of Baldur's Gate 3.

The controller adaptation is done very well. I tried the keyboard and mouse, but went back to the controller — the devs deserve nothing but praise for their controller support. But probably the most amazing artwork done in the game is voice acting — these characters were truly brought to life with amazing performances from the voice actors.

Onto some things I disliked. I was utterly disappointed with the lack of cool and unique gear and items, especially in Act 3. I've finished the game with more or less the same gear I had in Act 2. There isn't much progression or fun rewards, or hidden loot. I spent the whole game upgrading the stuff my characters had from the beginning.

As a turn-based newbie (I have played one, very different turn-based game before in my life), I liked the combat. It kept evolving slowly throughout the game. It never brought me any amazing experiences but it felt engaging. It wasn't too tactical, but it still required careful planning.

Unfortunately, most fights boil down to brute-forcing your opponent's health bar. To be able to fully take advantage of opportunities to be clever and use specific items to 'cheat' a fight, you have to be really experienced with the game and it's not something I could've done on my first, blind playthrough.

### Journey’s End — Final Thoughts

This game was probably the most hyped game I've ever played. Coming into it, I did not think that this game would replace some of my favorite games of all time, but I still had pretty high expectations because of hearing nothing but praise for the game for 2 years.

The overwhelming feeling I had while going through the game was that the game was constantly ramping up to a climax. Act 3 was supposed to be that climax, but it ended up being the a very carefully guided experience with little opportunity for organic fun. It had boring and forgettable villains and exhausting and annoying fights.

There is nothing more deeply unsatisfying than the story fizzling out in the later half. I think Act 3 would've benefited greatly if there were simply more things to do in the city and if every quest wasn't locked behind a specific quest chain. It was painful to see such a carefully created map, just for you to be forced to run from objective mark to objective mark.

This is a game that had a perfect story and world to build on. It could've been truly great, but it got dragged down by annoying gameplay elements and weird story decisions. What hurts most is the fact that these things were preventable, but sadly, I don't think that the devs ever heard this kind of criticism.

My game time clocked at 75 hours, with the game peaking around the 25–30 hour mark between the end of Act 1 and the beginning of Act 2. Baldur's Gate 3 is a 9/10 game for me, but it drags itself down, like the fastest race car using bad tires and bad fuel.

So the final verdict I will give this game is 8/10.

**Rating**: 8/10
